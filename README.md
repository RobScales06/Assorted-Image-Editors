# Assorted-Image-Editors
This is a set of python scripts that can be used to manipulate images in a variety of ways.

The user is prompted for an input image file and a title for an output file and the particular effect is applied to a copy of the original image.

This code requires explicitly written extensions.

If no output file is specified, the code will produce an output file of "processed_<filename>.<original extension>"

Please feel free to try these scripts and make adjustments.

Image processing may take time.

PIL & numpy libraries are necessary to run this code.
